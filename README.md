## Demo Project & Slides

Here you can find the demo project and the slides to my talk at the [heise MacDev 2019](https://www.heise-macdev.de/lecture.php?id=9974&source=0). The slides are in German and in Markdown format. It is highly probable that I will do an English version as well soon. You can view the slides using [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/).
